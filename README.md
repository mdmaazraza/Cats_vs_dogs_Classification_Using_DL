# Dogs vs Cats Classification
This project leverages deep learning to classify images of dogs and cats. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, the model is trained to distinguish between these two categories with high accuracy. The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from Kaggle, which contains thousands of labeled images of dogs and cats.

# Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Images are resized and augmented to improve model generalization.
* Model Architecture: The CNN architecture is fine-tuned to optimize performance on the Dogs vs Cats dataset.
* Evaluation Metrics: Model accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the classification performance.
# Dataset
* The dataset used can be found on Kaggle.

# Libraries Used
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
# Results
The model achieves strong accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks.

# Usage
